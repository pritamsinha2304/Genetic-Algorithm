        "\n",
        "    In every generation few are selected (good - with high fitness) chromosomes for creating a new offspring. Then some (bad - with low fitness) chromosomes are removed and the new offspring is placed in their place. The rest of population survives to new generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "    But the thing is, removing chromosomes is like removing `varieties/diversity` from the population. \n",

        "\n",
        "    Rank Selection also works with negative fitness values and is mostly used when the individuals in the population have very close fitness values (this happens usually at the end of the run). This leads to each individual having an almost equal share of the pie (like in case of fitness proportionate selection) and hence each individual no matter how fit relative to each other has an approximately same probability of getting selected as a parent. This in turn leads to a loss in the selection pressure towards fitter individuals, causing the GA to make poor parent selections in such situations.\n",

        "\n",
        "In the roulette wheel selection, the probability of choosing an individual for breeding of the next generation is proportional to its fitness, the better the fitness is, the higher chance for that individual to be chosen. Choosing individuals can be depicted as spinning a roulette that has as many pockets as there are individuals in the current generation, with sizes depending on their probability. Probability of choosing individual $i$ is equal to \n",

        "4. **Tournament Selection:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Tournament selection involves running several \"tournaments\" among a few individuals (or \"chromosomes\") chosen at random from the population. The winner of each tournament (the one with the best fitness) is selected for crossover. `Selection pressure`, a probabilistic measure of a chromosome's likelihood of participation in the tournament based on the participant selection pool size, is easily adjusted by changing the tournament size, the reason is that if the tournament size is larger, weak individuals have a smaller chance to be selected, because, if a weak individual is selected to be in a tournament, there is a higher probability that a stronger individual is also in that tournament.\n",
