# Genetic Algorithm

This is an implementation of genetic algorithm of simple binary string of length 30.
The expected output is 30, which is the sum of all the 1's in the binary string. So, basically I want the code to evolve to output binary string with all 1's.

The code **evolves** to the expected output.
